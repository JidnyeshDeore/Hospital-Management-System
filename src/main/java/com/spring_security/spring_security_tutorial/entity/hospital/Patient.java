    /*
        The StackOverflowError youâ€™re encountering is likely due to a recursive call in the toString() methods of your Doctor and Patient classes. 
        When you attempt to print a Doctor object, it tries to access its list of Patient objects, 
        which in turn calls the toString() method on each Patient. Since each Patient holds a reference back to its Doctor, 
        this creates a cycle that leads to infinite recursion.
        To fix this, you can modify the toString() methods to avoid this cyclic reference. Here's how you can do it
